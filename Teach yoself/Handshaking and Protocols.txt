Handshaking and protocols are methods used to ensure that different devices can communicate and that there are sets of rules that everyone
follows to ensure data is sent and received correctly.

They are needed because:
- There are so many different transimissions that take place between different types of hardware and software
- There are so many ways of handling and transmitting data
- Language differences

Protocols
------------

Protocols are sets of rules that apply to the transmission of data.
Examples of protocols include:
- TCI/IP - The set if rules that govern the transmission of packets of data around the internet
- HTTP -  The set of rules govern in which way 
- FTP

The Handshaking Process
--------------------------------

It is usually a process that takes place when a computer is about to communicate with a foreign device to establish rules for communacation.
Handshaking may be used to negotiate parameters that are acceptable to equipment and systems at both ends of the communication channel.
Handshaking makes it possible to connect realtively diverse systems or equipment over a communication channel without the need for human
intervention to set parametres.
