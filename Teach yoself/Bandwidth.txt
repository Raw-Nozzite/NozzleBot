Bandwidth is the term that describes the amount of data that can be transimitted along a communication channel. 
It relates to the range of frequencies that can be used to carry data.
The greater the range of frequencies, the greater the volume of data can be trasmitted uring a certain time-frame.

Bandwidth is measured in bits per second (bps) which is how many binary digits per second but measurements are usually taken in Kilobits or Megabits
per second.

Bandwidth has become a vital measure in assessing the speed of access to the internet. A 28.8Kbps modem will transmit and receive data at up to 28,800 bits
per second.

Baud rate is measured as groups so one signal can be used to convey 5 bits. The greater the bandwidth (range of frequencies) the higher the bitrate. If the
data rate of the digital signal is x bits per second then a very good representation can be achieved with a bandwidth of 2x Hz.
